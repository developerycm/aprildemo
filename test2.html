The main idea underlying the clause is to impart training (teaching) in arts and handicrafts to unemployed men and women. No doubt, the clause provides for payment for such work, but in the context, it must be understood as a payment in the nature of a stipend. It cannot be equated to regular wages; nor can the said clause be understood as establishment of a regular unit engaged in business in the said arts and handicrafts. As rightly pointed out by the Tribunal, clause 2(h) should not be read in isolation, but must be read along with other objects and interpreted having regard to the totality of the objects. The second question is accordingly, answered in affirmative, that is, in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue.">

The object clause of constitution emphasizes to propagate and disseminate knowledge about the auditing, accounting, direct and indirect taxes by holding seminars, conferences and workshops, etc. The fruits of seminars, conferences, etc., would be available to public at large, thus, it appears that society is not for the benefit of a small group of individuals and it is also not only for the benefit of members but to promote awareness and education of the commercial and tax laws for the general public without any profit motive. As observed by the Supreme Court, to serve a charitable purpose it is not necessary that the object should be to benefit the whole of mankind or all persons in a country or State, even if the section of public is given benefit, it cannot be said that it is not a trust for charitable purpose in the interest of the public. In the situation of explosion in population, the vast changes brought by the scientific technology and other developments, more particularly the universal concept of globalisation, new trends in the world in order to meet the ever growing challenges to organising seminars, conferences and workshops to educate the people of commercial laws, tax laws, auditing, accounting, direct and indirect taxes are of great general public utility at least to a section of people falling in the category of charitable institution.">

The land for development was provided by the State Government, by acquiring the same under the Land Acquisition Act. The land so given to the assessee was developed, inter alia, by providing for public amenities such as gardens, schools, religious places, community halls and shopping areas. The area available, after providing for access roads and streets as also public amenities, was then allotted in accordance with the State Government policies which included policy regarding reservation for specified categories such as members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, army personnel, sports persons etc. Any surplus funds, generated by sale of properties, were used by the assessee trust for general development of the assigned area. </p><p class="fr"> The AO noted that the plots, shops and flats were sold at market rates.

Nothing, therefore, turned on the assessee carrying out (even if that be actually so) activities in the nature of trade, commerce or business etc. as long as these activities were carried out in the course of actual carrying out of advancement of any other object of general public utility. </p><p class="fr"> In view of the above it held that the authorities below were not justified in declining the benefit of section 11 read with section 2(15) to the assessee, and in holding that the assessee trust was not covered by advancement of any object of general public utility. </p><p class="fr"> (g) Firozabad Shikohabad Development Authority v.
